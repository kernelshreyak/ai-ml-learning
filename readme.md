### Local setup

1. Setup virual environment (only needs to be done once)

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. Switch to the virtual environment

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install Jupyter extension in VSCode https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter

After completing above steps, any of the notebooks can be run like usual

### Azure AI learning

This folder contains notebooks which I used for testing during my learning for AI-900 and DP-900 courses from Microsoft
